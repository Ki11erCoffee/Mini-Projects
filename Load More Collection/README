This is a snippet from Main-Collection.liquid from shopifys theme. This code effectively renders a load more button to 
represent an infinite scroll on shopify instead of having pages. To make this code work we must also append an onclick method
to the input tags of the html doc for the filters shoppify uses so that we recall an ajax object.
